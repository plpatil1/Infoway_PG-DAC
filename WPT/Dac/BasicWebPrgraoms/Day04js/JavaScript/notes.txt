## Types of Website: 2 Types

1) Static Website: Website where where user cannot change it and only read purpose



2) Dynamic Website:- Website were user can make changes at runtime that's called Dynamic Website etc: whatsapp, instagram


when we use html, css, bootstrap only which is Static but if we use javascript for it so we can make it Dynamic Website.

Let's Learn javascript :-

# javascript :

-- it is use to add functionality into Web Application
-- it is loosely typed language
-- it interpreted language 
-- when we use variable in javascript we cannot tell what kind of data in it untill and unless we initilized it
-- 


* there are two ways to use javascript

1. Internal javascript : in Html File we write javascript in script, in head part 

2. External javascript : in this we create a seprate js file abd import it in html file by using script tag


* How to get or display output in javascript
1. document.write(): it will display output on browser
2. window.alert(): it will generare  popup window and display output in it #Global OR Main Object in javascript
3. console.log(): it will display output in browser console in terminal
4. innerHTML  (DOM): it is to insert data inside an element by using element id.

* in JavaScript there are three ways to create variable

var, let, const;

Q. why javascript is called as loosely typed?
--
Q.what is Hosting?
-- it is default javascript behavior which moves variable declaration at top. this we can use variable first and then declare it.

Q. what is Difference Between var, let and const?
-- ES(ECMA) script, 2009(ES5), 2015(ES6);

-- var: i) it create function  scope variable
        ii) it can reintialize variable

-- let: i) it create block scope variable
        ii) we not use variable before declaration of it
        iii) we can not redeclare variable 

-- const: i)its value never change at run time        
          ii) when we use declare it we have to initialized it.




* Function in javascript
-- it is block of code which is use to perform particular task/operation
-- function will execute only when we call it.
