# Create an Abstract class Processor with int member variable data  and method showData to display data value.
## Create abstract method process() to define processing of member data. 
## a. Create a class  Factorial using abstract class Processor  to calculate and print factorial of a number by overriding the process method.
## b. Create a class  Circle using abstract class Processor  to calculate and print area of a circle by overriding the process method
 ### Ask user to enter choice (factorial or circle area).  Also ask data to work upon; Use Processor class reference to achieve this mechanism*/
