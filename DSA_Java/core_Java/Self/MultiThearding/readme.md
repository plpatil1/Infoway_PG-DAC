# In Java, multithreading allows a program to execute multiple parts (threads) concurrently, improving efficiency and responsiveness, especially for tasks involving I/O or background operations. 

## What is Multithreading? 
#### Multithreading is a programming technique where a program can perform several tasks simultaneously by breaking them into smaller threads that can run independently. 
#### Each part of the program that is executed concurrently is called a thread. 
#### Threads share the same memory space and resources within a process, allowing for efficient communication and data sharing.
